Sample code for Fastly api used during security team meetup

## Requirements

1. Web Browser. Preferably Safari or Firefox
2. Text Editor. Preferably Visual Studio Code or Sublime. Available from Self Service app on Fastly provisioned laptop.
3. Githup (Optional). Desktop, CLI, etc. of choice.

## Explanation

We will work through creating a simple, single page web app (api.html). Through a series of "simple" steps, we'll progress from a simple html page to a nicely formatted list of users in a corp. 

There are numerous frameworks and tools to make life easier when doing JavaScript and CSS styling with a reasonable learning curve. We will be working with possibly the two most common frameworks - [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for JavaScript and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for CSS. 

## Steps

After downloading the repo either via git desktop, cli or simply download.
1. Open api.html in the browser.
2. Add in jQuery.
3. Make an API call.
4. Throw results of API on the page.
5. Add in Bootstrap and format the data. 
6. Check into Git (optional).
